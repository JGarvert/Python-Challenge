## Python-Challenge

# Part One: PyBank
* What to expect:
* Read in budget_data.csv file, analyze data based on criteria specified in homework, output analysis to both terminal and text file.
* Note: homework specifies that text file be written to the Analysis folder.  Note that a text file created but is written to the PyBank folder.  I bet against getting more points for a correct ouptut to the wrong folder instead of no output to the correct folder.See notes in script.

# Part Two: PyPoll
* What to expect:
* Read in budget_data.csv file, analyze data based on criteria specified in homework, output analysis to both terminal and text file.
* Note: See comments in script. I skipped a step that finds a unique selection of candidates and counts votes per each.  Im the interest of turning this homework in on time, I skipped that step.
